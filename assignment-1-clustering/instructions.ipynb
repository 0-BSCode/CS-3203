    "In this exercise (Assignment 1 of the Clustering Topic), we will try to develop a novel method of Target Trial Emulation by integrating concepts of Clustering into the already existing framework. Target Trial Emulation is a new methodological framework in epidemiology which tries to account for the biases in old and traditional designs.\n",

    "1. Look at this website: https://rpubs.com/alanyang0924/TTE\n",
    "2. Extract the dummy data in the package and save it as \"data_censored.csv\"\n",

    "3. Create another copy of your Python Codes, name it TTE-v2 (use Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "4. Using TTE-v2, think of a creative way on where you would integrate a clustering mechanism, understand each step carefully and decide at which step a clustering method can be implemented. Generate insights from your results.\n",

    "# `TrialSequence` Class Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TrialSequence` class is a Python implementation designed to emulate clinical trials for causal inference, specifically for per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. It mimics the functionality of the R package `TrialEmulation` by facilitating trial emulation, weight calculation, marginal structural model (MSM) fitting, and survival prediction. The class uses a `dataclass` structure to manage trial-related data and provides methods for data preparation, weight computation, trial expansion, model fitting, and prediction.\n",

    "## Notes\n",
    "- **Weight Calculations**: The class supports inverse probability weights for treatment switching (PP) and censoring (PP and ITT), crucial for unbiased causal inference.\n",
    "- **Trial Expansion**: The `expand_trials` method emulates randomized trials by creating a dataset where each eligible period for an individual starts a new trial.\n",
    "- **Survival Analysis**: Uses `statsmodels`’ `PHReg` for fitting a Cox proportional hazards model, allowing for time-to-event analysis.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: The class is designed to handle large datasets by processing individuals in chunks during trial expansion.\n",

    "## Limitations\n",
    "- The current implementation assumes a binary treatment variable (`0` for control, `1` for treatment).\n",
    "- Confidence intervals in `predict` are simplified and may not be statistically rigorous (consider using bootstrap methods for better intervals).\n",
    "- The baseline survival estimation in `OutcomeModel` may need enhancement to align with R’s event-driven approach (e.g., using Kaplan-Meier or Breslow estimator)."
